# Java Performance Tuning

This module focuses on understanding, measuring, and optimizing Java application performance.
It covers JVM tuning, garbage collection behavior, memory and CPU profiling, and benchmarking
strategies used in real-world production systems.

## Why Performance Tuning Matters
- Prevents latency spikes and outages
- Improves throughput under load
- Reduces infrastructure cost
- Required skill for backend and platform engineers

## Topics Covered
- JVM flags and runtime tuning
- Garbage Collection analysis
- Memory leak detection
- CPU bottleneck identification
- JIT compilation effects
- Micro-benchmarking best practices

This module complements JVM internals, concurrency, and memory management concepts.
