# Java SE – Complete Handbook (Basic → Advanced)

## 1. What is Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language designed for scalable applications. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), providing platform independence through bytecode execution.

### Why Big Tech uses Java
- Scalable backend and enterprise systems
- Strong concurrency and memory model
- Mature ecosystem with Spring, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark
- Long-term performance and stability guarantees

---

## 2. Java Runtime and Architecture

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| JDK | Development kit including compiler and tools |
| JRE | Runtime environment to run Java applications |
| JVM | Executes Java bytecode using Just-in-Time compilation |

### JVM Memory Layout
- Heap
- Stack
- Method Area
- Program Counter Register
- Native Method Stack

## 3. Java Basics

### Data Types
Primitive: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char  
Reference: objects, arrays, strings

### Operators
Arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, ternary, assignment

### Control Flow
if-else, switch, for, while, do-while, break, continue

---

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming

| Concept | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Class and Object | Blueprint and instance relationship |
| Encapsulation | Restrict direct access to internal fields |
| Inheritance | Reuse behavior from parent class |
| Polymorphism | One interface with multiple implementations |
| Abstraction | Hide internal details and expose essential functionality |

---

## 5. Strings and Immutability
String is immutable to ensure thread safety and caching.  
StringBuilder and StringBuffer allow mutable string operations for performance in concatenations.

---

## 6. Access Modifiers and Packages

| Modifier | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| private | same class |
| default | same package |
| protected | same package and subclass |
| public | everywhere |

---

## 7. Exception Handling

### Exception Types
Checked exceptions, unchecked exceptions, errors

### Exception Keywords
try, catch, finally, throw, throws

---

## 8. Collections Framework

| Interface | Implementations |
|----------|----------------|
| List | ArrayList, LinkedList |
| Set | HashSet, TreeSet |
| Queue | PriorityQueue, Deque |
| Map | HashMap, TreeMap, ConcurrentHashMap |

### Time Complexity Summary
- ArrayList: O(1) read, O(n) insert middle
- LinkedList: O(1) insert/remove, O(n) access
- HashMap: O(1) average access
- ConcurrentHashMap: scalable concurrent access

---

## 9. Generics

Enable compile-time type safety and reusable components.

```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
